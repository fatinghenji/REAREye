## Module Scope

Default scope includes these target processes:

- `android`
- `com.xiaomi.subscreencenter`
- `com.android.thememanager`
- `com.android.systemui`

## Requirements

- Android 16 / API 36 or later.
- LSPosed / Xposed compatible environment.
- Xposed minimum version 93.
- A target device with a rear screen. This repository mainly targets Xiaomi 17 Pro / 17 Pro Max.
- Root permission is required for some features or quick actions, such as force-stopping target apps
  and moving apps between the main and rear screens.
- Internet access is required for Rear Store, update checks, and contributor data.

## Installation

1. Download and install the latest APK
   from [Releases](https://github.com/killerprojecte/REAREye/releases).
2. Enable `REAREye` in LSPosed or a compatible framework.
3. Make sure the module scope includes `android`, `com.xiaomi.subscreencenter`,
   `com.android.thememanager`, and `com.android.systemui`.
4. Reboot the device, or at least restart the relevant target apps before configuring the module.
5. Open the module app and enable the features you need.

## Usage Notes

- After changing rear-screen whitelist, music controls whitelist, widget templates, notification
  routes, cards, or wallpaper rotation, restart `com.xiaomi.subscreencenter` or use the force-stop
  shortcut on the Home page, then reopen Subscreen Center.
- Notification routing depends on the bridge between `com.android.systemui` and
  `com.xiaomi.subscreencenter`. If route changes do not apply immediately, restart both target
  processes.
- System framework changes usually require a full reboot to apply reliably.
- Theme Manager changes should be followed by restarting `com.android.thememanager`; reboot if
  needed.
- Some quick actions and system-level features require root authorization.
- Store-managed widgets, cards, and notification routes keep their source metadata. Confirm whether
  you want to uninstall or overwrite them before manual edits.
- This module does not include a rear-screen app launcher. Use ADB or another launcher method if you
  need to start apps directly on the rear screen.
- After unlocking the template count limit, very large template sets should still be tested for
  stability.
- If Markdown previews in store details crash, disable WebView hardware acceleration in module
  settings.

## Use Cases

- Let more apps launch or stay alive on the rear screen.
- Use rear-screen media controls with more third-party music apps.
- Control lyric sources, displayed content, and handling logic.
- Install, update, and uninstall rear widgets or wallpapers from the store.
- Maintain rear widget templates, notification routes, and resident cards yourself.
- Manage rear wallpaper rotation, sorting, imports, metadata, and previews.
- Remove original Theme Manager limits for video wallpapers and template counts.
- Handle CN Google Play Services restrictions without flashing an extra Magisk module.
